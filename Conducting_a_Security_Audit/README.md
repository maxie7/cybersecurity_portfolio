## Scenario & Tasks

Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as their main office, a storefront, and warehouse for their products. However, Botium Toy’s online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She expresses concerns about not having a solidified plan of action to ensure business continuity and compliance, as the business grows. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to internally processing and accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).   

The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, listing assets currently managed by the IT department, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks and/or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture.

Your task is to review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment report. Then, perform an internal audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist. 

## Project Description

### Part 1: Setting the Foundation

In this comprehensive cybersecurity project, I had the privilege of conducting an internal security audit for Botium Toys, a growing U.S.-based toy company with an expanding online presence. The project was initiated in response to the IT manager's concerns about business continuity, compliance, and security risks associated with the company's growth and online operations.

**Audit Scope and Goals:**

The project began by collaborating with the IT manager to establish a clear scope and goals:

**Scope:** 

The audit covered Botium Toys' entire IT infrastructure, including physical and digital assets, online operations, payment processing, and compliance with EU regulations.

**Goals:**

Assess the current state of security posture.
Identify and document potential risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.
Evaluate compliance with payment processing regulations in the U.S. and EU.
Provide findings and recommendations to support the expansion of the IT department.
Risk Assessment:

A crucial step in the audit process involved conducting a comprehensive risk assessment. This assessment was instrumental in identifying and prioritizing potential risks to critical assets, business continuity, and compliance. It also helped determine the audit's focus areas.

### Part 2: Controls Assessment and Compliance Checklist

With the audit's foundation in place, the project moved into its second phase:

**Controls Assessment:**

To evaluate the effectiveness of existing security controls, I conducted a thorough assessment of Botium Toys' assets and control mechanisms. This involved:

Analyzing access controls and authentication methods.
Reviewing network security measures.
Assessing data protection practices.
Evaluating incident response procedures.
Examining employee training and awareness programs.

**Compliance Checklist:**

Compliance was a significant concern for Botium Toys, given its international customer base and online payment processing. I developed a detailed compliance checklist based on relevant regulations and standards, including GDPR and U.S. payment processing requirements. This checklist identified areas of non-compliance and provided actionable recommendations for improvement.

**Recommendations and Documentation:**

Finally, I compiled all findings and recommendations into a comprehensive report, ensuring clarity and conciseness in communication. The report served as a guide for Botium Toys to enhance its security posture, achieve compliance, and create the necessary documentation, processes, and procedures.

**Project Impact:**

This project not only contributed to enhancing Botium Toys' security and compliance but also facilitated the IT department's expansion. By aligning with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, conducting a thorough risk assessment, and providing actionable controls assessment and compliance recommendations, the project demonstrated the value of proactive cybersecurity measures in safeguarding critical assets, ensuring business continuity, and enabling global growth.

In my GitHub portfolio, you will find detailed documentation of this project, including the audit scope, goals, risk assessment methodology, controls assessment findings, and compliance checklist. These materials showcase my expertise in cybersecurity auditing, risk assessment, and compliance management, and they stand as a testament to my commitment to securing digital environments for businesses.
