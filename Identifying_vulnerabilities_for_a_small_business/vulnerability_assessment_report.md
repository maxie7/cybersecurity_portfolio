1st January 20XX
- - - -

### System Description

The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on
the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management
system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts
with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

### Scope

The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system.
The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 20XX to August 20XX. *NIST SP
800-30 Rev. 1* is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

### Purpose

At the heart of marketing operations lies the database server, a secure vault for massive amounts of business-critical data. 
This central hub stores everything from customer details to campaign results and valuable analytics. 
By keeping this information organized and accessible, the server allows marketers to track performance, identify trends, and tailor strategies for maximum impact. 
Because this data is essential for daily marketing activities, robust security measures are crucial to safeguard sensitive information and ensure the integrity of marketing efforts.

### Risk Assessment

| Threat source | Threat event | Likelihood | Severity |
| ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | -------- |
| Hacker        | Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration | 3 | 3 | 9 |
| Employee      | Disrupt mission-critical operations | 2 | 3 | 6 |
| Customer      | Alter/Delete critical infromation | 1 | 3 | 3 |

### Approach

Risks considered the data storage and management methods of the business. The likelihood of
a threat occurrence and the impact of these potential events were weighed against the risks
to day-to-day operational needs.

### Remediation Strategy

Implementation of authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms to ensure that only
authorized users access the database server. This includes using strong passwords, role-based
access controls, and multi-factor authentication to limit user privileges. Encryption of data in
motion using TLS instead of SSL. IP allow-listing to corporate offices to prevent random users
from the internet from connecting to the database.
