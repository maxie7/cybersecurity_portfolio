## Security Risk Assessment Report

### Part 1: Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement

Three key strategies can fortify cyber defenses. First, strict password policies and regular staff training foster secure credentials, thwarting unauthorized system access. Second, strengthened database controls like altered defaults, role-based access, and vigilant logging safeguard sensitive data. Finally, locked-down firewalls and intrusion detection systems monitor traffic and activity, shielding the network from misuse. Together these protocols harden systems against breaches, preserving institutional security.

### Part 2: Explain your recommendations

A multi-pronged strategy can harden defenses across the institution's systems. Tighter password policies and ongoing cybersecurity training will promote vigilant credentials management among staff, closing a key access vulnerability. Altering default admin passwords, implementing role-based database access, and monitoring activity logs will protect sensitive data by limiting exposure. Configuring firewalls to filter traffic and deploying intrusion detection puts robust controls around the network, shielding it from unauthorized access and suspicious acts. Together these measures create overlapping security layers, reducing attack surfaces. By locking down access, monitoring activity, and instilling a security-first culture, the organization can proactively armor itself against breaches across critical systems. A comprehensive hardening regimen represents the best path forward to modernize defenses in the face of increasingly sophisticated threats.

Implementing multifactor authentication (MFA) will strengthen access controls against brute force attacks while discouraging insider password sharing. Requiring a second credential like a biometric scan or code from an authentication app on top of a password makes credentials exponentially harder to crack. MFA should become mandatory, especially for admin users with elevated network privileges.

Additionally, a stringent enterprise password policy with complexity requirements and frequent rotation will thwart brute force and password spraying attacks. To be effective, these rules must be consistently enforced across the organization.

Finally, firewalls provide critical protection but require vigilant maintenance. Configuration updates and rule reviews after security events will ensure firewalls actively block suspicious traffic associated with denial-of-service (DoS/DDoS) and other attacks.

Together, robust MFA, password rules, and firewall hygiene create layered defenses against unauthorized access through stolen credentials or network exploitation. By proactively hardening these security protocols, the organization can significantly boost resilience against modern threats.
