## Cybersecurity Incident Report: OS hardening

### Section 1: Identify the network protocol involved in the incident

The cyberattack took advantage of vulnerabilities in two core internet protocols - DNS and HTTP - to carry out its malicious activities. By poisoning DNS records, the attackers were able to intercept domain name resolutions and point users to a fake website under their control. HTTP requests for accessing this fraudulent website were then manipulated to deliver malware payloads to victims' devices. Once infected, HTTP traffic was further exploited to seamlessly redirect users to the impersonating website. The strategic manipulation of DNS and HTTP enabled the key phases of the attack - initial intrusion, malware installation, and phishing site presentation. By subverting these fundamental protocols, the perpetrators were able to orchestrate unauthorized access, software distribution, and content deception on a massive scale.

### Section 2: Document the incident

The site YummyRecipesForMe was compromised by a brute force attack that exploited the admin account's default password. Gaining backend access enabled the attacker to inject malicious JavaScript into the website's codebase. This JavaScript covertly triggered downloads of an executable file that hijacked browser settings. Victims were then seamlessly redirected to a convincing but fraudulent version of the website, where premium content could be accessed for free. The security breach resulted in stolen customer data, website corruption, and significant malware risks to users. The incident underscores the criticality of strong access controls and rigorous code auditing to safeguard against unauthorized changes. YummyRecipesForMe failed to update default credentials or detect inserted scripts, enabling an attack vector that jeopardized security and integrity.

### Section 3: Recommend one remediation for brute force attacks

To prevent future brute force attacks like the one suffered by YummyRecipesForMe, implementing an account lockout policy is strongly advised. This preemptive control temporarily disables access after a set number of sequential failed login attempts. By hampering password guessing efforts, account lockouts significantly impede the feasibility of brute force attacks. YummyRecipesForMe should also configure automated alerts to inform administrators when lockouts occur, enabling prompt investigation and response. While minimizing inconvenience to legitimate users, these safeguards harden defenses against brute forcing. By adopting account lockouts and alerting, YummyRecipesForMe can shore up vulnerabilities exposed by this incident, promoting greater website security overall. Proactively building defenses will allow YummyRecipesForMe to thwart similar attacks going forward.
