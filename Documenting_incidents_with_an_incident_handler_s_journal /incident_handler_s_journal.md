| Description          | Documenting a cybersecurity incident <br><br> This incident occurred in the two phases: <ol><li>**Detection and Analysis:** The scenario outlines how the organization first detected the ransomware incident. For the analysis step, the organization contacted several organizations for technical assistance</li> <li>**Containment, Eradication, and Recovery:** The scenario details some steps that the organization took to contain the incident. For example, the company shut down their computer systems. However, since they could not work to eradicate and recover from the incident alone, they contacted several other organizations for assistance.</li></ol> |
| Tool(s) used | None |
| The 5 W's | <ul><li>**Who:** An organized group of unethical hackers</li><li>**What:** A ransomware security incident</li><li>**Where:** At a health care company</li><li>**When:** Monday 9:00 a.m.</li><li>**Why:** The incident happened because unethical hackers were able to access the company's systems using a phishing attack. After gaining access, the attackers launched their ransomware on the company's systems, encrypting critical files. The attackers' motivation appears to be financial because the ransom note they left demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key.</li></ul> |
| Additional notes | <ol><li>How could the health care company prevent an incident like this from occurring again?</li><li>Should the company pay the ransom to retrieve the decryption key?</li></ol> |

| Description          | Analyzing a packet capture file |
| Tool(s) used | For this activity, I used Wireshark to analyze a packet capture file. Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer that uses a graphical user interface. The value of Wireshark in cybersecurity is that it allows security analysts to capture and analyze network traffic. This can help in detecting and investigating malicious activity. |
| The 5 W's | <ul><li>**Who:** N/A</li><li>**What:** N/A</li><li>**Where:** N/A</li><li>**When:** N/A</li><li>**Why:** N/A</li></ul> |
| Additional notes | I've never used Wireshark before, so I was excited to begin this exercise and analyze a packet capture file. At first glance, the interface was very overwhelming. I can see why it's such a powerful tool for understanding network traffic. |

| Description          | Capturing the first packet |
| Tool(s) used | For this activity, I used tcpdump to capture and analyze network traffic. Tcpdump is a network protocol analyzer that's accessed using the command-line interface. Similar to Wireshark, the value of tcpdump in cybersecurity is that it allows security analysts to capture, filter, and analyze network traffic. |

| Description          | Investigate a suspicious file hash |
| Tool(s) used | For this activity, I used VirusTotal, which is an investigative tool that analyzes files and URLs for malicious content such as viruses, worms, trojans, and more.  It's a very helpful tool to use if you want to quickly check if an indicator of compromise like a website or file has been reported as malicious by others in the cybersecurity community. For this activity, I used VirusTotal to analyze a file hash, which was reported as malicious. <br><br>This incident occurred in the **Detection and Analysis** phase. The scenario put me in the place of a security analyst at a SOC investigating a suspicious file hash. After the suspicious file was detected by the security systems in place, I had to perform deeper analysis and investigation to determine if the alert signified a real threat. |
| The 5 W's | <ul><li>**Who:** An unknown malicious actor</li><li>**What:** An email sent to an employee contained a malicious file attachment with the SHA-256 file hash of 54e6ea47eb04634d3e87fd7787e2136ccfbcc80ade34f246a12cf93bab527f6b</li><li>**Where:** An employee's computer at a financial services company</li><li>**When:** At 1:20 p.m., an alert was sent to the organization's SOC after the intrusion detection system detected the file</li><li>**Why:** An employee was able to download and execute a malicious file attachment via e-mail.</li></ul> |
| Additional notes | How can this incident be prevented in the future? Should we consider improving security awareness training so that employees are careful with what they click on? |

| Description          | As a level-one Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst at our financial services company, I have been tasked with responding to an ongoing security incident. This incident involves a phishing alert indicating that a suspicious file has been downloaded onto an employee's computer. Following the investigation of the email attachment's hash, it has been confirmed that the attachment is indeed malicious. To address this threat effectively, I am following our organization's established process, as outlined in our playbook, to conduct a thorough investigation and resolve the alert. |
| Tool(s) used | In the course of this investigation, I leveraged the following tools: <br><br>VirusTotal: This tool was employed to analyze the suspicious file with the SHA-256 hash 54e6ea47eb04634d3e87fd7787e2136ccfbcc80ade34f246a12cf93bab527f6b. |
| The 5 W's | <ul><li>**Who:** An unknown malicious actor</li><li>**What:** An email sent to an employee contained a malicious file attachment with the SHA-256 file hash of 54e6ea47eb04634d3e87fd7787e2136ccfbcc80ade34f246a12cf93bab527f6b</li><li>**Where:** An employee's computer at a financial services company</li><li>**When:** At 1:20 p.m., an alert was sent to the organization's SOC after the intrusion detection system detected the file</li><li>**Why:** An employee was able to download and execute a malicious file attachment via e-mail.</li></ul> |
| Additional notes | The alert detected that an employee downloaded and opened a malicious file from a phishing email. There is an inconsistency between the sender’s email address “76tguy6hh6tgftrt7tg.su’” the name used in the email body “Clyde West,” and the sender’s name, “Def Communications.” The email body and subject line contained grammatical errors. The email’s body also contained a password-protected attachment, “bfsvc.exe,” which was downloaded and opened on the affected machine. Having previously investigated the file hash, it is confirmed to be a known malicious file. Furthermore, the alert severity is reported as medium. With these findings, I chose to escalate this ticket to a level-two SOC analyst to take further action. |

| Tool(s) used | Chronicle  |
| The 5 W's | <ul><li>**Who:** I am a security analyst working at a financial services company.</li><li>**What:** In this task, I was assigned to investigate a security incident involving a phishing email with a suspicious domain name, "signin.office365x24.com," identified in an employee's inbox.</li><li>**Where:** The investigation took place within the network infrastructure and email systems of the financial services company.</li><li>**When:** The query and investigation were initiated on April 01, 2024, as part of the incident response process.</li><li>**Why:** The objective was to determine if other employees had received phishing emails containing the same suspicious domain and whether any of them had visited the domain. This investigation is crucial for identifying potential phishing campaigns and mitigating security risks.</li></ul> |
| Additional notes | Using Chronicle, a cloud-native SIEM tool, I conducted a query to search for related phishing emails with the domain "signin.office365x24.com." This investigation aims to identify any similar security threats affecting multiple employees within the organization. Chronicle's capabilities are instrumental in efficiently searching and analyzing security data to respond effectively to potential incidents and protect the company's sensitive information. |
